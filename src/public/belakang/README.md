Ace v2.1.4
---

Thanks for using Ace admin template.  

Basic files inside `node_modules` folder are included to view the demo.  
For full functionality and to customize CSS and JS files, you should run `npm install` to install required tools, libraries, frameworks.  

You may also need to install `git` if see an error like this:  
```
npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall spawn git
```


Then you can either:
* Open `index.html`
* Run `PORT=6000 node index.js` and then open `http://localhost:6000/`


To view documentation open `documentation.html`.  

Let me know if you have any questions.
